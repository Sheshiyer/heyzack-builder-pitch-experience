## Golden Rules for Copy

### 1. Lead with Outcomes, Not Specs
❌ **Avoid:** "2K/1080p live view with PIR motion detection"  
✅ **Better:** "See every visitor before they knock. Know your home is protected even when you're away."

### 2. Use Homeowner Language
❌ **Avoid:** "Zigbee 3.0 IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networking protocol"  
✅ **Better:** "Works reliably throughout your entire home, even in the far corners"

### 3. Connect Features to Feelings
| Feature | Feeling Translation |
|---------|---------------------|
| Motion detection | Peace of mind |
| Energy monitoring | Monthly bill relief |
| Remote access | Control from anywhere |
| Automated schedules | Time saved |
| Two-way audio | Never miss a moment |

### 4. One Benefit Per Bullet
Each bullet should deliver a single, clear value proposition:
- ✅ "See exact energy usage for each connected appliance instantly."
- ❌ "Monitor energy with real-time tracking and historical data visualization across multiple time periods."

## Connected Scenes Copy Framework

Connected scenes show how products work together. Each scene should follow this structure:

### Scene Copy Template
```
Label: [Action]-[Object] (e.g., "Auto-Porch", "Leak-Block")
Description: [Trigger] + [Action] + [Benefit] (≤120 chars)
Impact Metric: [Quantified outcome or qualitative benefit]
```

### Example Transformations

**Before (Too Technical):**
> "PIR trigger lights up porch for arriving guests."

**After (Benefit-First):**
> "Motion at your door automatically brightens the entry, greeting visitors and deterring intruders."

**Before (Feature List):**
> "Sends smartphone alerts when someone rings the doorbell"

**After (Outcome-Focused):**
> "Never miss a delivery—instant alerts reach your phone the moment someone arrives."

## Fact-Checking Reference

### Always Verify Against Product Catalog

Before writing or editing copy, cross-reference `data/product_catalog.json`:

| Claim Type | Where to Verify |
|------------|----------------|
| Resolution/quality | `specs` field |
| Connectivity | `specs` field (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth) |
| Battery life | `specs` field |
| Power ratings | `specs` field (voltage, amperage, wattage) |
| Compatibility | `connected_scenes` and `automations` arrays |
| Weatherproofing | `specs` field (IP ratings) |

### Acceptable Inference Labels

When specs aren't explicit, mark assumptions:
- `[Assumed from visual]` — Design/form factor inferences
- `[Industry standard]` — Common specifications for product type
- `[Implied by ecosystem]` — Based on Tuya/Zigbee compatibility

### Forbidden Claims

| ❌ Never Claim | ✅ Alternative |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Best in class" | "Precision-engineered for reliability" |
| "Industry-leading" | Cite specific metric if available |
| "Revolutionary" | Describe the actual innovation |
| Unverified percentages | Use "up to" or cite catalog source |
| Made-up brand lore | Stick to product capabilities |
