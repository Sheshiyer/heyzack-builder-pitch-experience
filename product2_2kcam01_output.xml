    <current_assessment>The current name "Camera Indoor (USB-C) - HZ-C-2KCAM01" is overly technical and functional. It reads like a SKU rather than a consumer product. The inclusion of the model number and connector type in the primary title creates friction for non-technical homeowners.</current_assessment>
