• Two-way talk lets you calm the dog or greet the kids from the grocery line.
• Motion alerts ping your phone the instant something moves, so surprises become certainties.

Ask any smart speaker or glance at any smart display to pull up the feed instantly. The camera tucks neatly on a shelf, keeps power through one discreet USB-C cable, and syncs with every mobile device you already own.

Bring the whole home into view, and never wonder what's happening inside again.</current_description>
